# Testing
HTML
No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator

CSS
No errors were returned when passing through the official CSS (Jigsaw) validator

Using the problem bar in the coder also helped me to fix bugs. 
Some examples are:

-No styles entered in CSS (empty rules)- I had a couple of errors show where I had started a rule but not entered the information. The problem bar was great at helping me identify and fix these.
- Expected/unexpected curly brackets found on certain lines were stopping me from progressing.

I used chrome developer tools to test the site to make sure it was designed responsively. There were certain parts of the site such as the .textright class paragraphs that weren't working properly until I added the media queries. I made sure it worked at mobile level, tablet level and desktop level.
