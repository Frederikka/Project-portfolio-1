# Recyke

Recyke is a freecycle community that is focused on helping people to make the best use out of their belongings, so they can recycle within their local area and reduce waste. 


# Features

This wesbite is for people who want to have a better impact on the planet and so is there to try help provide ways to achieve this. Recycke is designed to help people share ideas on how to do this. There is a navigation bar to help users navigate to the following sections:
there is a home page explaining who Recycke are and what they aim to do. There are links to "their" social media sites. There is a tips page with basic ways to start getting involved. There is a contact section for people to get in touch with any suggestions. 
There are background images for each page reflecting the ethos of the collective. 


# Technologies used

# Testing
HTML
No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator

CSS
will be tested when finished with (Jigsaw) validator

Using the problem bar in the coder also helped me to fix bugs. 
Some examples are:

-Couldnâ€™t style icons- had to add rule for selector i in class

-No styles entered in CSS (empty rules)- I had a couple of errors show where I had started a rule but not entered the information. The problem bar was great at helping me identify and fix these.
